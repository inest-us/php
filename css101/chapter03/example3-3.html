    <h1>Descendant Selectors</h1>
    <p>
        Descendant selectors apply styles based on ancestral relationships.
        The first descendant example I present applies style to the
        <span class='code'>&lt;span&gt;</span> element named <em>code</em>,
        which is a descendant of <span class='code'>&lt;p&gt;</span> elements.
        To do this, the selector <span class='code'>p span.code</span> is used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using CSS, styles can be applied to any number of documents.  Since
        this is the case, there may be <span class='code'>&lt;span&gt;</span>
        elements with a class name of <em>code</em> in several documents, but
        have different styles applied depending on the context it appears,
        which is the exact situation the inventors of the descendant
        selector had in mind when it was conceived.
    </p>
    <p class='note'>
        The note text is given different styles.  To do this another descendant
        selector is used.  This time the selector is <span class='code'>p.note
        span.code</span>
    </p>
