    <p class='container'>
        A class represents something that you can have more than one of.
        You aptly name your class to reflect the type of item that you
        may or may not have more than one of.  The class name for this
        paragraph is <i>container</i>.  It could very well be that you
        have many containers, or just one.
    </p>
    <p class='container box'>
        You can chain together class names within the class attribute.
        From a purely semantic standpoint, the class names may or may
        not have a relationship with each other.  Here, the class names
        are <i>container</i> and <i>box</i>.  It could be said that boxes
        and containers are related, since <i>box</i> is a type of
        <i>container</i>.
    </p>
    <p class='container tank'>
        It is wise to put thought behind the naming conventions you use
        within a document.  Here, <i>tank</i> is another type of
        <i>container</i>.  All containers have some properties in common.
        Dimensions, color, volume, etc.  But some containers may have
        properties that are unique to that container. Perhaps it has a
        different color, or capacity, or is intended to hold a different
        kind of material.
    </p>
    <p class='container' id='container-1234'>
        An id is used but once per document.  Semantically speaking, the
        id should be able to identify uniquely, and be descriptive.
        You may have several containers, but only one container has the id
        <i>1234</i>.  Since only one container is named <i>1234</i>, it
        becomes easier to find that container among the others.
