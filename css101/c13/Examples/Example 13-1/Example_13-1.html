            The media attribute lets you control what styles are applied to which
            media.  PC and Mac browsers use the values print, all, and screen,
            but there are many more media types than these.
        </p>
        <p id='print'>
            The @media rule can also be used to control styles based on medium,
            but it can do so directly from the style sheet, with no need for HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            The @media rule simply wraps the rules that are to be applied to a
            particular medium.
