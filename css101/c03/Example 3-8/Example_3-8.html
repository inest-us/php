            You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat.
            You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los
            Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly
            the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there.
            The only difference is that there is no cat.
