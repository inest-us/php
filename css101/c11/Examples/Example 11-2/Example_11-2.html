            Relative positioning has two primary purposes in web design.
            The first purpose is to create a point of reference for
            an absolutely positioned element.  When an element with absolute
            positioning is nested within an element with relative positioning,
            the absolutely positioned element is positioned in context to
            the dimensions of the relatively positioned element.
        </p>
        <div id='relative'>
            <p>
                Relative positioning is a lot like static positioning; elements
                don't appear to leave the flow of the document.
            </p>
            <p id='bottom-right'>
                This element is positioned to the bottom right of the
                relatively positioned element.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The four offset properties can also be applied to relatively
            positioned elements, which can be used to modify the position
            of an element.
        </p>
        <div>
            <p id='offset'>
                This element is offset from its original position.
            </p>
        </div>
