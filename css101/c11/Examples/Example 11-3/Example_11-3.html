            The concept of fixed positioning is pretty straightforward.
            Elements with a fixed position stay in place, even when a document
            is scrolled.  Elements with a fixed position are always positioned
            relative to the browser's viewport, no matter where they appear
            in a document's structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            IE6 and IE7 in quirks mode do not support fixed positioning, even
            though IE7 in standards mode does support fixed positioning.  Some
            tricks are employed to make the document work in IE6, in standards
            mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though fixed positioning technically allows an element to be
            placed anywhere in the document's structure, the IE hacks that I
            present here require that fixed position elements always be immediate
            children of the &lt;body&gt; element.
        </p>
        <p id='long'>
            This element is used to make the document longer, so that scroll bars
            are invoked.
