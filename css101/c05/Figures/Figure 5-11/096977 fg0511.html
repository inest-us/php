            "Fettuccine alfredo is macaroni and cheese for adults."

            "Rice is great if you're really hungry and want to eat two
            thousand of something."

            "When I went to England to tell this joke, I had to find out if
            they knew who Smokey the Bear was. But they didn't. In England,
            Smokey the Bear is not the forest fire prevention representative.
            They have Smacky the Frog. It's just like a bear, but it's a
            frog. I think it's a better system, I think we should adopt it.
            Because bears can be mean, but frogs are always cool. Never has
            there been a frog hopping toward me, and I thought "Man, I'd
            better play dead. Here comes that frog..." You never say 'here
            comes that frog' in a nervous manner. It's always optimistic.
            "Hey, here comes that frog, all right. Maybe he'll settle near
            me, and I can pet him, and stick him in a mayonnaise jar, with a
            stick and a leaf, to recreate his natural environment."
