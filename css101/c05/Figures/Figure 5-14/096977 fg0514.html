            text-decoration styles can be combined. For instance, you can
            have <span class='underover'>text that is underlined and
            overlined</span>.  You can have
            <span class='overthrough'>text that is overlined with a line
            through</span>.  You can even have
            <span class='underoverthrough'>text that is underlined,
            overlined, with a line-through</span>.  <b>Why</b> you would want
            to do this is another question altogether.
